# PuzzleBubble
Basic puzzle bubble game. Group matching colour bubbles to make them fall down. This project uses a depth-first search algorithm to determine which bubbles fall, if any, when a shot bubble collides with the grid. Currently, floating bubbles will not fall. This will be fixed in later versions.

Press space to fire bubbles. Mouse movement or 'A' and 'D' keys will rotate the turret.
